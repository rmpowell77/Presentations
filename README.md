# Presentations

Archive of the presentations I've given at various conferences and meetups.  As I am a fan of using keynote, I've saved off the keynote files (including all the complexity of the various versions of file formats over the years) and a PDF rendering of each.

General form will be <Conference/Meetup name>/<Year>/<Title>.
